# **Brew**Lens
> A modern, web-based explorer for Homebrew Casks and Formulae.

## What is BrewLens?

BrewLens is a modern browser-based tool that fetches and parses **Homebrew Cask and Formula** metadata directly from official Homebrew sources. It helps developers and power users inspect application and command-line tool details with clarity and speed — all without using a single terminal command.

You can browse both **Casks (macOS Apps)** and **Formulae (CLI Tools)**, including:

  * Version details (stable, etc.)
  * Installation commands
  * Homepages and download URLs
  * SHA256 checksums
  * Dependencies and build dependencies
  * Artifacts (for casks)
  * Full JSON representation
  * Deprecation and disable status
